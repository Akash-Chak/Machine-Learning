# Student Marks Prediction
* In this notebook we will implement Regression models to predict students marks using the below mentioned data. We will go through different regression models to find out best fit,after doing preprocessing/cleaning and then selecting the features.Comparing different regression models we will find out the best one.
## Dataset
* We are using data on student grades collected from a Portuguese secondary (high) school. This data is from the UCI machine learning repository, a great collection of datasets for model testing. The data includes academic and personal characteristics of the students as well as final grades. The objective is to predict the final grade from the student information which makes this a supervised, regression task. We have a set of training data with known labels, and we want the model to learn a mapping from the features (explanatory variables) to the target (the label) in this case the final grade. It is a regression task because the final grade is a continuous value.
